        "This question deals with the Weekly data set, which is part of the ISLR2 package. This data is similar to the Smarket data from the lab section (4.7) that you worked on earlier today, except that it contains 1,089 weekly returns for 21 years, from the beginning of 1990 to the end of 2010. Note that for this exercise, all the code you need is available in the notebook for the lab. If you did not follow this notebook yet, you are strongly suggested to do so first."
